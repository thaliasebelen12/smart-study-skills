                    <p>The act of trying to remember ideas, through techniques like flash cards to practice tests, actually helps make it easier to remember those ideas and connect them to each other.</p>

                    <p>It’s easier to remember ideas that we can visualize and connect to ideas we already know. Learning and creating specific examples of abstract concepts does just that.</p>
